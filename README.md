A clone of the Sundown Studio website built for practice using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **GSAP animations**, and **Swiper.js**. This project helped me explore scroll-based animations, DOM manipulation, and slider functionality without relying on frameworks like React.

## 🚀 Features

- Smooth scroll-based animations with **GSAP**
- Interactive sliders powered by **Swiper.js**
- Scroll-triggered elements and transitions
- Fully responsive layout
- Pure **HTML**, **CSS (SCSS)**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
